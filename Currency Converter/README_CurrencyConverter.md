## About the Project

This is a simple Python-based currency converter I made to understand how user input, basic calculations, and exchange rate logic work together. It's a beginner-friendly script, and I kept things straightforward without using any external APIs.

## What I Learned

- Handling user input using Python‚Äôs `input()` function
- Doing basic arithmetic operations like multiplication and division
- Using dictionaries to store and use exchange rates
- Structuring the code in a clean, interactive way

## How It Works

When you run the script, it asks for:

1. The amount you want to convert
2. The source currency code (like USD or EUR)
3. The target currency code

It then calculates and prints the converted value using predefined rates.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This is a basic implementation using static exchange rates ‚Äì it doesn't fetch live data.

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed. Download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if needed.
2. Clone or download this repo to your system.
3. Open terminal/command prompt, navigate to the project folder.
4. Run:

```bash
python main.py
```

Follow the prompts, and it‚Äôll show you the converted amount.
